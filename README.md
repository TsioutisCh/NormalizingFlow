# NormalizingFlow
Part of master thesis. A flow based generative model implemented to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Quantum Oscillators.

This repository contains the code used for the simulation of Metropolis and Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms for the Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator. RealNVP.py contains the implementation of RealNVP (normalizing flow) to the same physical system.
